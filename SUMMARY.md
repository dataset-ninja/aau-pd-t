**AAU-PD-T: Aalborg University Person Detection Thermal Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the surveillance domain. 

The dataset consists of 2941 images with 7809 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*person*).

Images in the AAU-PD-T dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 1997 (68% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (1941 images) and *test* (1000 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 9 phenomena: ***snow*** (1060 images), ***shadow*** (171 images), ***wind*** (167 images), ***low_resolution*** (158 images), ***good_condition*** (122 images), ***similar_temperature*** (107 images), ***opposite_temperature*** (72 images), ***far_viewpoint*** (64 images), and ***occlusion*** (20 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Aalborg University, Denmark</span>.
